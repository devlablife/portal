            <div className='mb-4'>

              <p> For a better experience while using our Service, we may require that you provide us with

              <p> Cookies are files with a small amount of data that is often used as anonymous unique
                identification. These are
                sent to your browser from the website you visit and are stored on the internal memory of
                your device. </p>
              <p> This Service does not use these "cookies" explicitly. However, the app can use
                third-party code and libraries
                that use "cookies" to collect information and improve their services. You have the
                ability to accept or decline
                these cookies and to know when a cookie is being sent to your device. If you choose to
                decline our cookies, you
                may not be able to use some parts of this service. </p>
